- `script.js` - Main JavaScript code with operator examples and conditionals
- `Problem_1.js` - Additional problem exercises

## Key Concepts

- Understanding the difference between == and ===
- Pre-increment vs post-increment
- Conditional logic flow
- Ternary operator for concise conditional expressions

## How to Run
