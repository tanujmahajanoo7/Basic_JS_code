# Chapter 12: Asynchronous JavaScript and Callbacks

This chapter introduces asynchronous programming concepts in JavaScript including setTimeout, callbacks, and callback hell.

## Topics Covered

- **setTimeout()**: Delaying code execution
- **Callbacks**: Understanding callback functions
- **Asynchronous Execution**: How JavaScript handles async code
- **Callback Hell**: Nested callbacks and their challenges
- **Callback Patterns**: Passing functions as arguments

## Files

- `index.html` - HTML structure
- `script.js` - Asynchronous JavaScript examples
- `part2.js` - Additional async examples
- `part3.js` - More callback patterns
- `part4.js` - Advanced async examples
- `style.css` - Stylesheet

## Key Concepts

- Understanding the event loop and asynchronous execution
- Using setTimeout for delayed execution
- Creating and using callback functions
- Understanding callback hell problem
- Sequential data fetching with callbacks

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Open the browser's developer console (F12)
3. Observe the order of console logs to understand async execution
4. Notice how setTimeout delays code execution
5. See callback functions in action with data fetching examples
